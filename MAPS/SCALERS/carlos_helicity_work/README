The make_scaler_db.py python code reads in a .map file and generates a db_HScalevt.dat and db_PScalevt.dat file which
is read in by the analysis replay script. To generate the .dat file,  load the desired .map file. This is done by changing
the xscalerMapName filename within the make_scaler_db.py script.  Then, do:  >> ./make_scaler_db.py.  Make sure that the
.dat files are placed in the correct directory for the replay script to read them.

Here is a summary of the scaler hardware/software changes,
and the corresponding map files that should be used depending
on the experimental run period.

============================

3/29/2018 : Pooser installed +Hel, -Hel, MPS, signals in slots 14/15 of hcvme08 crate : https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3549997

8/17/2018 : SIS3801 scaler to be used for helicity installed physically in slot 4 of hcvme08: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3588509

8/23/2018 : a copy of the pre-trigger input signals was fanned out into slots 14/15 of hcvme08: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3590581

10/23/2018 : S. Wood added new scaler (hcvme08, slot4) to deal with delayed helicity reporting: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3613942

************************************

10/24/2018 : 1) removed hcvme08 slots 14/15 non-delayed helicity scaler,
             2) install new scaler in hcvme08 slot3, (this log entry should say "slot4", NOT "slot3")
	     3) install equivalent scaler in hcvme05 slot19,
	     4) added QRT signal to ROC02::slot14::Ch07. H-, H+, MPS were
	        already present in Ch:08-10 of said slot. Added QRT, H-, H+,
		MPS to ROC01::slot18::Ch07-10 : https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3614445

10/25/2018 : 1) S. Wood added helicity readout to hcvme05, so there would be redundant readout of Helicity scalers in both HMS/SHMS scaler crates.
             2) changed inputs in helicity scalers (hcvme05/08) such that inputs 0-15 were BCM-related scaler signals and 16-31 were trigger-related
	        scaler signal, however, the latter was left unplugged (thought it was not useful), but can be plugged back
		reference log: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3614778

10/25/2018 : 1) S. Wood plugged back the trigger-related scalers and updated software to readout 16-32 for both HMS/SHMS
                reference log: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3614836

06/20/2019 : 1) M.K.Jones added Hall A beam modulation status to scalers and updated the scaler maps:
                reference log: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3690562

************************************


12/21/2019 : 1) S. Wood added beam-charge-asymmetry calculation in hcana helicity scaler class
                reference log: https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3757052
