1) Calculate yield
	1) ../hcana yield_calc.C
	2) Enter run number
	3) Enter index specifying target

	It will warn you if you're overwriting a run already in coin_yield.root,
	but this might be what you want to do!

2) Plot yield per run
	1) ../hcana yield_graph.C
	2) Make sure yield hasn't fluctuated
